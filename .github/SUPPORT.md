## Support Policy

We will always support the latest stable Firebot release. Previous stable releases will be supported for **no more than 30 days** after a newer stable update has been released. After 30 days, you must be on a supported version in order to receive support via our official channels (Discord, GitHub, etc.).

Pre-release versions (e.g. betas) are no longer supported **immediately** upon a corresponding stable release or if superseded by a newer pre-release (e.g. `5.66.0-beta1` would immediately become unsupported upon release of either `5.66.0-beta2` or a `5.66.0` stable release). Nightly releases continue to receive limited support due to their potentially unstable nature.
